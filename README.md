# AI Talent Match & Storytelling Dashboard

An intelligent HR analytics system that compares employeesâ€™ capabilities against benchmark top performers to identify best-fit candidates for specific roles. The app provides data-driven visual analytics, AI-generated job profiles, and automated HR insights to support **Talent Intelligence and Succession Planning**.

## Overview

This project combines **data analytics, AI narrative generation, and interactive visualization** to help HR teams:
- Evaluate employeesâ€™ readiness for specific roles.
- Identify high-potential talents and benchmark top performers.
- Generate automatic job profiles and competency insights using AI.

All processing and visualization are implemented in **Python** and **Streamlit**, with data stored in a **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** database.

## Key Features

### Talent Benchmarking
- Compares each employeeâ€™s **Competency**, **Strength DNA**, **Cognitive**, **Behavior**, and **Readiness** scores.
- Benchmarks are defined from **top performers** in the selected job level (Grade IIIâ€“V).

### Interactive Visual Analytics
- **Radar chart** to compare top candidates vs benchmark.
- **Heatmap** and **bar charts** for TV and TGV gap analysis.
- **Strength distribution** to identify frequent high-performing traits.

### Automated HR Insights
- AI summarizes top candidatesâ€™ fit levels and improvement areas.
- Insight bullets categorized as **fit summary**, **strength amplifiers**, and **development suggestions**.

### AI Job Profile Generation
- Uses **OpenRouter API (Claude 3 Haiku)** to produce:
  - Job Requirements (bulleted list)
  - Narrative Job Description
  - Key Competencies (with tools)
  - Why Top Candidates Rank Highest

### Data-Driven Insights
The analysis notebook `discover_pattern.ipynb` explores:
- Distribution of top performers.
- Tenure, grade, and education patterns.
- Psychometric availability and data integrity.
- Feature engineering and rating cleaning steps.
